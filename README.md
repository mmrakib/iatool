`iatool` is my personal quantitative investment analysis tool. I use it for analysing and screening stocks, bonds, ETFs and other securities to allow me to rebalance my portfolio and make sound investment decisions.

The tool employs both an API and a CLI for the user to interface with. It also employs comprehensive documentation for the sake of both accessibility and transparency. Every function implemented in the tool comes with an explicit reference and a rigorous mathematical proof.
