`iatool` is my personal quantitative investment analysis tool.

I use it for analysing and screening securities to help me rebalance my portfolio and make sound investment decisions.

The tool features various quantitative tools, metrics and models for various types of analysis, including fundamental analysis, technical analysis, risk analysis, macroeconomic analysis, option pricing, and so on. It covers various financial instruments, including equity instruments (e.g. stocks), fixed-income instruments (e.g. bonds), derivatives (e.g. options), ETFs, commodities, and so on.

The tool employs both an API and a CLI for the user to interface with. It also employs comprehensive documentation for the sake of both accessibility and transparency. Every function implemented in the tool comes with an explicit reference and mathematical description.
